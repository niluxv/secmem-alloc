`secmem-alloc` is a crate designed allocate private/secret memory. It is
intended to be used for storing cryptographic secrets in memory. This crate
provides custom allocators using various techniques to improve secrecy of
the memory, most notably zeroization on deallocation.

## Examples

For example, we read in a secret password from standard-in, which we want to
zeroize on drop (deallocation). Note that this code does leave the password
visible on the prompt; it is only to give an idea of how to use this crate.

```rust
#![feature(allocator_api)]
// requires `nightly_allocator_api` crate feature to be enabled and a nightly compiler
use secmem_alloc::allocator_api::{Allocator, Global, Vec};
use secmem_alloc::zeroizing_alloc::ZeroizeAlloc;

fn read_password<A: Allocator>(buf: &mut Vec<u8, A>) {
    // query password from the user and put it in `buf`
}

fn main() {
    println!("Please enter your password: ");
    let mut stdin = std::io::stdin();
    let allocator = ZeroizeAlloc::new(Global);
    let mut password = Vec::new_in(allocator);
    read_password(&mut password);

    // use `password` however you like
    // you can even grow and shrink the vector `password` and if it needs to be reallocated, the
    // old allocation is immediately zeroized

    // password is automatically zeroized on drop (deallocation)
}
```

As a second example assume you have a cryptographic secret key of 256 bytes,
which should be zeroized on drop. In addition, we don’t want the key to be
written to swap.

```rust
// requires no crate features and works on stable
// if you enable the `nightly_allocator_api` crate feature, the following line is necessary
#![feature(allocator_api)]

use secmem_alloc::allocator_api::{Allocator, Box};
use secmem_alloc::sec_alloc::SecStackSinglePageAlloc;

fn get_secret_key<A: Allocator>(buf: &mut Box<[u8; 256], A>) {
    // fill `buf` with the bytes of the secret key
}

fn main() {
    let allocator: SecStackSinglePageAlloc =
        SecStackSinglePageAlloc::new().expect("could not create allocator");
    let mut key = Box::new_in([0_u8; 256], &allocator);
    get_secret_key(&mut key);

    // use `key` however you like
    // `key` will not be written to swap except possibly on hibernation

    // `key` is automatically zeroized on drop (deallocation)
}
```

## Cargo features

* `std` (default): Enable functionality that requires `std`. Currently only
  required for `Error` implements and required for tests. This feature is
  enabled by default.
* `nightly_allocator_api` (requires nightly): Use the nightly allocator api
  from the standard library (actually the `core` crate), gated behind the
  nightly-only feature `allocator_api`. When disabled, a copy of the
  allocator api included in this crate, available through
  `secmem_alloc::allocator_api`, will be used. This feature requires a
  nightly compiler.
* `nightly_core_intrinsics` (requires nightly): Use the intrinsics from the
  standard library (actually the `core` crate), gated behind the
  nightly-only feature `core_intrinsics`. This allows for a slightly faster
  [`zeroize_mem`][__link0] implementation, and various other small optimisations.
  This feature requires a nightly compiler.
* `nightly` (requires nightly): Enable all nightly-only features (i.e. the
  above two). Enabling this feature is highly recommended when a nightly
  compiler is available. This feature requires a nightly compiler.
* `dev` (requires nightly): This feature enables all features required to
  run the test-suite, and should only be enabled for that purpose. This
  feature currently requires a nightly compiler.

## MSRV Policy

Since this crate still depends on several nightly features for optimal
functioning, the MSRV is expected to track the latest stable relatively
closely. Therefore, we might bump the MSRV in patch version bumps. This
shouldn’t be an issue given the new MSRV aware dependency resolver in
cargo. This policy might change as more unstable features get stabilised.
